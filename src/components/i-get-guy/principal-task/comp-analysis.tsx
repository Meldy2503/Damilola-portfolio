        After assessing the both competitors I realized different types of gap
        that could be fixed. In my analysis, Urban Clap is treated as solely a
        Business to Customer (B2C) service provider app where users do not have
        the autonomy to relates directly with the artisans (you book a service
        and get an artisan assigned to you).
      </Text>
      <Text>
        This however makes some of the artisans run their business off the app,
        while some of the customers get under qualified services. Task Rabbit on
        the other hand comes as a B2B and a B2C, allowing services providers
        (artisans) showcase themselves as businesses, while on the customerâ€™s
        end, they get high rates of services and a really slow response to
        service request.
